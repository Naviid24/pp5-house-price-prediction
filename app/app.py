### üè° Project Overview
Welcome to the **Ames House Price Prediction App**! 

The client is interested in discovering how house attributes correlate with sale price. 
To support this, we provide visualizations that show relationships between key variables and sale price.

Additionally, the client wants to predict the sale price of her four inherited houses, as well as any other house in Ames, Iowa, USA üá∫üá∏.
This app allows users to explore the data and make predictions based on specific house features.
