# üè† House Price Prediction

## üìò Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates house sale prices based on various property features. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle‚Äôs Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). We created a fictitious use case in which predictive analytics are used to support real estate valuation for a property management platform.

Each row in the dataset represents a **single residential property**, and each column contains an attribute of that property. These attributes include **structural characteristics**, **quality assessments**, **construction details**, and **location-specific data**. The goal is to use these features to predict the `SalePrice` of a house.

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can support **real estate professionals** and **property investors** in making data-informed decisions about pricing and valuation.
